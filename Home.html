    <p> Amra Pacariz is a director of brand marketing,
       with experience managing global teams and multi-million-dollar campaigns
       . Her background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management
        inform her mindful but competitive approach.
        Amra is fueled by her passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising.
         She considers herself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on her academic foundations in
          psychology and sociology and stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through 
          continued coursework and professional development.
          Her hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to her
           most recent success at Rockwell Group. There, she led international award-winning campaigns for 
           heavy-hitting brands such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex.</p>
