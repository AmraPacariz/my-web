    <p>   Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield, England. 
      The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), 
      Jamie Cook (lead/rhythm guitar) and Nick O'Malley (bass, backing vocals). Former band member
       Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was 
       released. Their sound has changed extensively from album to album with the only constant being the clever
       rics of frontman Alex Turner. All four members of the band were devoted fans of hip-hop when they were younger. For some members,
        like Alex Turner and Matt Helders, things changed when they heard certain bands.</p>

    <p> Breakfast on Pluto is a 2005 comedy-drama film written and directed by Neil Jordan and based on the
       novel of the same name by Patrick McCabe, as adapted by Jordan and McCabe. The film stars Cillian
        Murphy as a transgender foundling searching for love and her long-lost mother in small town Ireland
         and London in the 1970s.To prepare for the lead role of Kitten, Murphy studied women's body language and for a few weeks met with a drag queen who instructed him and took him out clubbing with friends.[1]

         Neil Jordan and Pat McCabe made big changes to the story in their adaptation of the novel for the 
         silver screen. In the book, the protagonist is called "****", but Jordan and McCabe rename her "Kitten" 
         in the film.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="column3">
    <p> Unlike the highly sexual ****, who is sexually involved with numerous male and female 
      characters in some rather kinky situations as well as a few long-term relationships, Kitten doesn't
       even kiss another character on the lips. One sexual encounter for hire is strongly implied, 
       but Kitten is not shown being overtly sexual with anyone on screen. Kitten's flirtatious relationships
        with the series of male characters she meets throughout the film are never shown or strongly implied 
        to have been consummated, 
      leaving the yearning main character unrequited.The seaside scene between Kitten and Bertie was considered
       by some to be an allusion to director Jordan's earlier film The Crying Game, which also involved a transgender major character,
        the IRA, and actor Stephen Rea. In The Crying Game, Rea's character doesn't realize that the woman he has fallen for and becomes
         sexually involved with is transgender.In Breakfast on Pluto, Kitten confesses that she's "not a girl" before Rea's character can kiss her, 
         and he says kindly that he already knew, but does not follow through with the kiss.

        The author of the novel upon which the film is based, co-screenwriter Patrick McCabe, has a cameo in the film as
         Kitten's creative writing teacher.</p>

      <p> Léon: The Professional (French: Léon), 
        titled Leon in the UK and Australia (and originally titled The Professional in the US), 
        is a 1994 English-language French action-thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson.
         It stars Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, and Natalie Portman (in her film debut). The plot follows Léon (Reno),
          a professional hitman, who reluctantly takes in 12-year-old Mathilda (Portman), after her family is
           murdered by corrupted Drug Enforcement Administration agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Léon and
            Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the hitman's 
            trade.Léon: The Professional is to some extent an expansion of an idea in Besson's earlier 1990 film,
             La Femme Nikita (in some countries Nikita). In La Femme Nikita, Jean Reno plays a similar character 
             named Victor. Besson described Léon as "Now maybe Jean is playing the American cousin of Victor. 
             This time he's more human."</p>

      <p> While most of the interior footage was shot in France, 
        the rest of the film was shot on location in New York City. 
        The final scene at school was filmed at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, 
        New Jersey..Léon: The Professional received positive reviews from critics. The film holds a 73% positive
         aggregate rating based on 64 critical reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus states, 
         "Pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hitman and his 12-year-old apprentice—a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman—Luc
          Besson's Léon is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller".[17] At Metacritic, 
        the film received an average score of 64 based on 12 reviews, indicating "Generally favorable reviews".
        Mark Salisbury of Empire magazine awarded the film a full five stars. He said, "Oozing style, wit and confidence from every sprocket, and offering a dizzyingly,
         fresh perspective on the Big Apple that only Besson could bring, this is, in a word, wonderful".Mark Deming at AllMovie awarded the film four stars out of five, 
         describing it as "As visually stylish as it is graphically violent", and featuring "a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman,
          and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman".</p>
